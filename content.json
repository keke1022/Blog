The following are some of the problems I encountered when I am taking tests on the DMV Website. Hope that helps! Problem and AnswerThe “No zone” is: A term used to describe blind spots around a truck or bus. From top to bottom, the following is the proper order for traffic lights: Red, Yellow, Green Park speed limit: 15 mph Unless otherwise posted, the speed limit in condominium complexes is: 25 mph. Unless otherwise posted, the speed limit on state highways is: 55 mph Unless otherwise posted, the maximum speed limit on freeways is: 70 mph. A reflective orange triangle on the back of a vehicle indicates: It is a slow-moving vehicle. When passing a large vehicle, the driver of a small vehicle must be prepared for: Wind gusts produced by the large vehicle. A “No standing” sign at a certain location means: You may stop temporarily only to pickup or discharge passengers. What is the first thing you should adjust, if needed, when you get into a car to drive? Seat While backing, you should: Turn your head and look through the rear window. A flashing red traffic signal at an intersection has the same requirements as: A stop sign. The driver’s left arm and hand are extended downward. This hand signal means that the driver plans to: Stop When merging onto a freeway, it is usually best to: Accelerate to the speed of freeway traffic. When you park uphill on a street with a curb: Turn the front wheels away from the curb. A flashing red traffic light means the same thing as a stop sign. You must come to a complete stop, yield to cross traffic and pedestrians, and then proceed when the way is clear. What should you do if your accelerator sticks while you are driving? Shift to neutral and apply steady pressure on the brake. When driving in normal traffic conditions, you should signal to turn ____ before beginning the turn. 100 feet Signs indicating areas of public recreation are: Brown When driving in traffic, it is safest to: Drive with the flow of traffic. When faced with an oncoming car to the left and a bicyclist to the right, you should: Let the car pass and then pass the bike. When traveling on a multilane roadway with traffic moving in opposite directions, how should drivers use the shared center lane? To slow down or stop before turning left. The correct way to use a freeway exit ramp is to: Slow down once moving onto the exit ramp. Your body gets rid of approximately: One alcoholic drink an hour. A broken yellow line alongside a solid yellow line means: Passing is permitted from the lane next to the broken line. It is illegal for a person 21 years of age or older to drive with a minimum blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of: 0.08 percent. You may not park within ____ of a railroad crossing. 50 feet Drivers should always look down the road ____ ahead of their vehicle. 12 seconds Your horn should be used as a warning in situations where you think another driver or a pedestrian does not see you. For example, if a child begins to run into the street in front of your vehicle, you should sound your horn. During normal weather and traffic conditions, keep a minimum following distance of: Three to four seconds. During adverse weather and traffic conditions, or increased driving speeds, keep a following distance of: Six or more seconds. A bicyclist who doesn’t obey traffic laws: Can be ticketed. The driver of a passenger vehicle must change lanes completely when passing a motorcycle. Certain highway signs require drivers to obey an indicated instruction. Such signs are known as: Regulatory signs. Signs that are colored orange are: Work zone signs. You are stopped in a line of vehicles waiting at a stop sign. If there is no cross traffic after the vehicles ahead have passed through the intersection, you: Must stop again at the stop sign or stop line before proceeding. You want to turn left at an intersection. The light is green but oncoming traffic is heavy. You should: Wait in the center of the intersection for traffic to clear. A leaky exhaust system in your vehicle is dangerous because it can cause: Carbon monoxide poisoning. When parallel parking, you should park within ____ inches of the curb. 12 A driver can legally pass on the right side of another vehicle: If the vehicle is waiting to turn left and there is an available passing lane. A “No stopping” sign means that, unless directed to do so by a police officer, you may stop only: To avoid conflict with other traffic. A speed restriction sign: Shows a recommended speed for a curve or turn. If a green arrow turns into a solid green light, you: May still turn, but you must yield to oncoming traffic. If traffic signals at an intersection are not functioning due to a power outage: Treat the intersection as a four-way stop. six or more one-point violation / 12 or more points within two years -&gt; reexaminations","link":"/2023/12/28/Driver-Licence-Test/"},{"title":"Crash Course of Dafny","text":"From https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny.

Function ClosureFunctions can use bindings from outside the function definition (in scope where function is defined) Here is an example:123456789fun A() = let val x = 10 (* A local variable in A's scope *) (* B is a closure that uses x from A's scope *) fun B(y) = x + y in B (* A returns B as a closure *) end;The closure B maintains access to the environment it was created in A’s local scope, even after A has completed execution. Anonymous FunctionsUse keyword fn: fn x =&gt; 3*x Lexical ScopeLexical Scope means the scope where function is defined. Function bodies can use bindings in the lexical scope. This is because a function value has two parts, which forms a pair: the code the environment where the function is defined This pair is called function closure. For instance, the binding fun f y = x + y bound f to a closure. Here is a quiz:1234fun f g = let val x = 9 in g() endval x = 7fun h() = x+1val y = f hIt is x=8 under lexical scope and x=10 under dynamic scope. Under dynamic scope, the body of function h would end up “seeing” the local binding of x to 9 and if we removed this local binding (since it appears to have no purpose), then dynamic scope would lead to an undefined variable. Map, Filter, FoldFoldfold(f, acc, [x_1, x_2, x_3]) computes f(f(f(acc, x_1), x_2), x_3) The implememtation is:12345(* ('a * 'b -&gt; 'a) * 'a * 'b list -&gt; 'a *)fun fold (f, acc, xs) = case xs of [] =&gt; acc | x::xs =&gt; fold (f, f(acc, x), xs) Here is a sample function checking whether all elements in xs satisfies function g,1fun f (g, xs) = fold ((fn(x, y) =&gt; x andalso g y), true, xs) Currying12345val f = fn x =&gt; fn y =&gt; fn z =&gt; z &gt;= y andalso y &gt;= xval res = (((f 3) 4) 5)(* Syntatic sugar *)fun f x y z = z &gt;= y andalso y &gt;= x Therefore, instead of writing (((f 3) 4) 5), ML uses f 3 4 5.

For example, a computer library might need to tell whether a client has pressed his key. The purpose of these libraries is to let multiple users register to some events using “callback”. However, a library cannot tell whether a client needs extra messages to finish his computation. A function closure is ideal because a function type t1 -&gt; t2 does not specify any other variables it uses.

They are sent to a router, and now the router wants to figure out how many distinct IPs. Let $n$ be the number of distinct IPs. If using a hashmap, it may take $O(n)$ space to implement. We can allow $n$ within a range: Pr[\\hat{n} \\in \\{ (1-\\epsilon)n, (1+\\epsilon)n \\}] < \\deltaCall it the “$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$” guarantee. We are aiming for a space of $O(\\epsilon^{-2} \\log{\\frac{1}{\\delta}})$. Aim Find an unbiased estimator (Random Hash Function). Reduce the variance (Apply Chebychev). Reduce the error probability (Apply Chernoff-Hoeffding). In general, a Random Hash Function is like: $h(IP address) \\rightarrow [0, 1]$. $h(a)$ is uniformly in the interval of [0, 1] and is independent. Min Sketch MethodWe are using the “Min sketch”: $Y = min(h(a_1), \\cdots, h(a_M))$. The reason is that $Y$ is good as it filters out duplicates of $a_i$. The distribution of $Y$ is only affected by the number of distinct elements in $\\{a_1, \\cdots a_M\\}$. Intuitive GuessThis process is equivalent to getting the smallest among $n$ random values between $[0, 1]$.Intuitively, this result is $\\frac{1}{n+1}$, because we can take $n = 1$ and the result is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Mathematical ProofE(Y) = \\int_{0}^{1} Pr(Y\\geq x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} Pr(Y\\geq x) \\, dx= \\int_{0}^{1} (1-x)^n \\, dxTherefore the expectation of $Y$, E(Y) = \\int_{0}^{1} x^n \\, dx = \\frac{1}{n+1}The estimation of $\\hat{n}$: $\\hat{n} = \\frac{1}{Y} - 1$. But this expected value of $\\hat{n}$ is infinite as $E\\left[\\frac{1}{Y}\\right] \\rightarrow \\infty$. To prove this, we make a partition between $[0, 1]$ | $\\cdots$ | $\\frac{1}{8}$ | $\\frac{1}{4}$ | $\\frac{1}{2}$ | In reality, E\\left[\\frac{1}{Y}\\right] \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\times 1 + \\frac{1}{4}\\times 2 + \\frac{1}{8} \\times 4 + \\cdotsMultiple Hash FunctionsWe use $k$ hash functions and take its mean to approximate this $Y$, i.e., $Z = \\frac{Y_1 + Y_2 + \\cdots Y_k}{k}$. The expectation of $Z$ is equal to that of $Y$, i.e, $E(Z) = \\frac{1}{n+1}$, and its variance is reduced. Variance of $Z$Remember that, Var(Y) = E(Y^2) - E(Y)^2Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)Var(c) = c^2 Var(X)Therefore the variance of $Z$, Var(Z) = \\frac{1}{k^2} \\sum Var(Y_i) = \\frac{1}{k} Var(Y_i)Then we calculate the variance of $Y_i$, denote as $Y$. E(Y^2) = \\int_{0}^{1} Pr(Y^2\\geq x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} Pr(Y\\geq \\sqrt{x}) \\, dx= \\int_{0}^{1} (1-\\sqrt{x})^n \\, dxLet $u = 1 - \\sqrt{x}$, then $x = (1-u)^2$, $dx = -2(1-u) du$. E(Y^2) = \\int_{1}^{0} -2(1-u)u^n \\, du = 2\\int_{0}^{1} (1-u)u^n \\, du = \\frac{2}{(n+1)(n+2)}Var(Y) = E(Y^2) - E(Y)^2 = \\frac{2}{(n+1)(n+2)} - \\frac{1}{(n+1)^2} \\leq \\frac{1}{(n+1)^2}Therefore we get the variance of $Z$, Var(Z) = \\frac{Var(Y)}{k} \\leq \\frac{1}{k(n+1)^2}Chebychev InequalityUsing Chebychev, Pr(|Z - \\frac{1}{n+1}| \\geq \\frac{\\epsilon}{n+1}) \\leq \\frac{Var(Z)}{(\\frac{\\epsilon}{n+1})^2} \\leq \\frac{1}{k\\epsilon^2}Picking $\\frac{1}{k\\epsilon^2} \\leq \\frac{1}{3}$ (Randomly, just a small value), then $k = \\frac{3}{\\epsilon^2}$. $Pr(\\frac{1}{Z} - 1\\textit{ is a good estimate}) \\geq \\frac{2}{3}$. We can pick $k$ larger, but it is not practical, because we are paying for the accuracy, $k = \\frac{\\delta}{\\epsilon^2}$. ImprovementsWe take multiple $Z$ and get their median: W = median(Z_1, \\cdots Z_k) median is more robust than simply $Z$ As long as good estimates is more than half, we are happy with that result. Define $I_i = 1$ when $\\frac{1}{Z} - 1$ is a good estimator. $E[I_i] \\geq \\frac{2}{3}$, $X = I_1 + \\cdots + I_l$, then $E(X) \\geq \\frac{2l}{3}$. $Pr(X \\leq \\frac{l}{2}) = Pr(\\frac{X}{l} \\leq \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{6}) \\leq e^{-2 \\frac{1}{6^2} l}$ This is a logarithmic approximation. The Space (in bits): $3 \\epsilon^{-2} \\log{\\ln{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\cdot 64$bits.","link":"/2023/12/04/Special%20Topic/"},{"title":"Abstract","text":"This is the Abstract part for SJTU WDP PurposeExplore the rationality of the supply and demand of medical resources in fever clinic in Jinshan Street in Fuzhou and then determine the next location of a clinic. DescriptionThe covid-19 virus is getting serious at present. It is obvious that the medical resource could not meet with the increasing need. Therefore, we aim to explore how to distribute medical resource to ensure the health of the population in Jinshan Street to the greatest extent possible. In our project, medical resource is reflected in fever clinics. The overall health condition is evaluated by local severe cases. Data needed Addresses of communities in Jinshan Street Population of communities in Jinshan Street Scale of fever clinics in Jinshan Street StepsPart I: Supply and Demand Evaluation Simulation of the outbreak for a period Use SEIR model Set parameters to reflect the real situation in a region Evaluate whether supply and demand meets Draw the curve of severe cases The slower rate of increase, the lower peak value, the better supply and demand meets Part II: Optimal Location of the Next Clinic Divide the map into grid Take advantage of a heat map to show the effectiveness of each cell as the fifth location","link":"/2023/01/08/abstract/"},{"title":"Discussion","text":"This is the Discussion part for SJTU WDP Discussion Simulation: Due to a lack of data, many assumptions are made, which may not be consistent with the real situation here. This will cause errors. However, those missing information can be acquired somehow for better simulation. Assumptions: The pattern of movement between zones within the region in a typical day is randomized Solution: the exchange of population between zones can be obtained by phone data like public transportation usage The transition rate between Infected and Recovered is the same for all regions Solution: count the average recovering time for each region, which is related to population structure and clinics scale, etc. Evaluate Supply and Demand relation Currently, we use the formula peak value for infected cases divided by the time to peak to reflect the seriousness of outbreak in a region. However, we should also take into account factors such as the proportion of severe disease and the extent of economic damage. For example, communities with a large proportion of elderly people should be given priority. Select the location for the fifth clinic We design the effectiveness of a new location as a formula. $cost=\\sum_{i=0}^n w_0((x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2)$ $w_0$ reflects the seriousness of the outbreak in the community. For the convenience, the clinic should be built nearer to area with serious situation. We aim to minimize the cost value in order to select the optimal location. There is still some room for improvement. We divide the Jinshan Street into $n=21$ communities, and treat them as a point with correspoinding population for the sake of convenience. However, a community consists of many residential quarters, and each residential quarter has many buildings. This method can be optimized given real population data of Jinshan Street. In this way, we could treat people in the same building as a whole and build more complex but accurate models The distance between the new clinic and communities are all straight-line distance. However, we should consider public transport development and road condition. For future research, we may take advantage of map software to calculate the real distance.","link":"/2023/01/08/discussion/"},{"title":"eecs445 notes","text":"Notes for EECS 445 feature, labels space: $\\bar{x}^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, $y^{(i)}$ $S_n = \\{ (\\bar{x}^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) \\}_{i=1}^{n}$ Linear Decision Boundary Overfitting, underfitting $\\bar{x}^{(i)} = [x_{1}^{(i)}, x_{2}^{(i)}, \\cdots, x_{k}^{(i)}]$ Hyperplanes in $\\mathbb{R}^d$: $\\bar{\\theta} \\cdot \\bar{x} + b = 0$. $\\bar{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is called parameter vector, $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the offset.","link":"/2024/01/17/eecs445-notes/"},{"title":"Methods","text":"This is the Method part for SJTU WDP Method Simulation of coronavirus outbreak: SEIR model (sample code + pic) The population can be divided into four compartments: Susceptible (those who can catch the disease) Exposed (those who are exposed to the disease but don’t have symptoms yet) Infected (those who show symptoms and are infective) Recovered (those who have recovered and become immune).
